I have a repertoire of maybe five or six phrases that I repeat ad nauseam. Just uttering "Henry" in most meetings will get an eye roll & "[faster horse][1], yeah, yeah". If I've explained UX as more than just tactical design & testing once, I've explained it a thousand times.

But, these are important, oft-forgotten (sometimes I think on purpose) concepts, so I keep beating the drum. Sometimes I even roll my eyes along with my audience.

[Staying Competitive through Strategic UX Design][0] (PDF) does a better job than I do in advocating for moving UX up the value chain. They key is redefining how your organization thinks about UX.

> If one defines user experience ... as something to do with just the design of a product or service, then that kind of user experience may not actually lead to long-term differentiators.
>
> One the other hand, if one defines UX more broadly as the **strategy, innovation, and design** of the compelling, delightful, and persuasive user experiences, then there is bound to be long-term differentiation and success.

This isn't to say a UX professional exceptionally skilled in interaction design should be promoted to pushing long-term strategy for an organization or product. Instead, this about incorporating user experience thinking into product managers and executives in a way that drives consistency.

As Apala Lahiri says,
