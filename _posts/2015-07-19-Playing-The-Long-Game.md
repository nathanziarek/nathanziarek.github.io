(I believe this is *Late to the Party*'s first ever political post. Don't read this as a for-or-against article. Take it as an interesting reminder that *focus* is important.)

As someone who has been critical of President Obama seeming lack of execution after promising rhetoric, I can appreciate Josh Marshall's take on his legacy.

>When I look at Obama I don't see a President desperately trying to cram legacy achievements into the declining months of his presidency. I see achievements coming to fruition that were usually years in the making but often seemed errant or quixotic and uncertain in their outcome. This is what for many was so bracing about the end of June. This has been a long long seven years. What seemed like an uncertain list of achievements, long on promise but hacked apart by mid-term election reverses and Obama's sometimes over-desire for accommodation, suddenly appeared closer to profound, like a novel or a play which seems scattered or unresolved until all the pieces fall into place, clearly planned all along, at the end.

Agree or disagree with the man, it has to be admitted that his swan song has reflected what we expected of him initially: passionate progressivism.
