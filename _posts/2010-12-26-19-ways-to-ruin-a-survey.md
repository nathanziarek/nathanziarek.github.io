[Jared Spool pretty much obliterates][1] United’s WiFi survey. My favorite:

> Crappy Survey Lesson #14: Don’t bother with good English. “On which airline did you last use a Wi-Fi service onboard?” It’s a one sentence question. Convoluted grammar doesn’t help the experience.

Definitely worth a read.
