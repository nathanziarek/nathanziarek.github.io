1. **Yay Milwaukee**! I doubt we'll get it --- there have to be thousands of applicants, and I don't know what would make MKE special --- but I love that we're putting our name out there based at least somewhat on constituent feedback.

2. The editor must have thought the article was too short, and decided to plop the PR implications for Google in there. Those two quotes read out-of-place and aren't really even right. This is an easy way for Google to get some extra impressions, but if they decide to launch a full-scale ISP, they already have the most viewed page on the web to advertise on. They aren't worried about gimmicks. 

3. Is there a more vocal and dissatisfied-with-life group of people than JSOnline commenters? Lighten up!
