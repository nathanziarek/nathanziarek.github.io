Nielson's claim ("things that are close together on the screen are seen as related") shouldn't shock anyone, but I think this article is more about designing for actual content, not just best-case.

I can think of any number of times I've produced really strong wireframes only to see them fall apart in the design stage because the text was shorter or longer and pushed other elements.

Keeping in mind the fluid nature of most interfaces --- windowed systems, web browsers --- is critical to ensuring that even the most well-thought-out functions work as intended.
