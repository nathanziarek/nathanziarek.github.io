> For his UIE Virtual Seminar, Answered! Your Top Questions on Web Form Design, Luke addressed the most common questions that he has gotten on web form design. The seminar brought about even more questions and today Luke and Jared Spool address those questions in this follow up podcast.

Side note: I love the transcripts for these podcasts. Sometimes it's just easier to read than dedicate an hour to listening.
