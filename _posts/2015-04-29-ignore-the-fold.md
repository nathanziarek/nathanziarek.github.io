*(I should probably consider just forwarding this blog over to [Luke W]'s site. Every time he posts I want to write about it!)*

The "fold" is one of those web concepts that just won't die. Unlike some of my other colleagues, I think that's for pretty good reason--even though what constitutes *above* or *below* the fold changes with the myriad of devices out there, the general idea that something at the top of the screen will be the most viewed *feels* obvious. *Obviousness* doesn't equal *rightness*, but it's easy to see why idea carries on.

Much like the concept of *[banner blindness]* (where visitors ignore banner-like components of a page), this research further shows that users adapt to route around the impediments we put in their way. That the user begins to scroll **before the page has loaded** is especially interesting. Unlike ignoring ad banners, this shows users have almost built muscle memory to scroll first and ask questions later.

From [Chartbeat]:

They're not even waiting for your hero image to load before skipping it. 

As with any user research, this may or may not apply to your particular customer base. There are a number of analytics tools available to help you track how users scroll on your site. It's not really something I've considered valuable before, and it really makes me think:

What else am I not thinking to measure?
