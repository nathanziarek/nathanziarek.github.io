It's really kind of a shame this article by Marli Mesibov was so directed at copywriters. It's a great general piece on the benefits of user research.

>Every project I work on **involves some measure of user research**, whether I work on my own or with an official research team. Sometimes I observe users as they use products. Other times I set up tree tests to see how users react to my terminology and nomenclature. When it’s all over, I work with the client to establish a message they want to communicate.

I've been trying to make the point lately that ***user experience** is everyone's job*. When I see tools like tree mapping or field research--tools commonly referred to as part of the UX toolkit--in use outside of a typical UX department, it only goes to prove that point.

The more we know about our users from top to bottom--engineers, designers, and product managers--the more likely we are to build cohesive products that work for the user.
