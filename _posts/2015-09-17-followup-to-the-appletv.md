A few months back, I broke down my thoughts on [how to build a better TV experience][1]. There are some nuggets of good ideas in there, but I've come to realize I made a rookie UX mistake: I was enamoured with the features (playing in Keynote was a blast) and lost sight of the story. What are the user's needs? How do people approach TV-as-entertainment?

With the announcement of the [new AppleTV][2], Apple has made their vision clear: apps are the future of TV.

This isn't revolutionary or even particularly shocking. It's a natural evolution of the App Store model that's now firmly entrenched in the post-PC world. Migrating the idea of "channels" to "apps" brings a lot of benefits, making TV more than just a screen with video. (As a college hoops fanatic, I see sports apps with the most obvious implementations. Games could be shown with the "director's track" or allow users to choose their own camera angle. Stats could be looked up real time. Oh the possibilities!)

The **app model** isn't without downsides and comes with three large issues that need (or will soon need) addressing.

Disparate Interfaces for Navigating Content

Say what you want about the ugliness of the cable company DVR, but the interface for finding shows on NBC wasn't different than that for HBO. The now-old AppleTV was the same way--different apps had different levels of categorization and different names, but the general layout of the screens stayed relatively consistent.

I'm no fuddy-duddy--allowing the content companies to explore and innovate interfaces is awesome and will lead to a lot of great (and a lot of horrible) ideas. On the balance, I'd prefer the collective mind of millions of programs coming up with the next best interaction, but that doesn't mean it comes without expense.

With the new AppleTV, I've already spent more time than I'd like to admit to trying to find Netflix's "List" or Hulu's Watchlist. Which leads us to...
