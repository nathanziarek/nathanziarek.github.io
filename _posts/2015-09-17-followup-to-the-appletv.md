A few months back, I broke down my thoughts on [how to build a better TV experience][1]. There are some nuggets of good ideas in there, but I've come to realize I made a rookie UX mistake: I was enamoured with the features (playing in Keynote was a blast) and lost sight of the story. What are the user's needs? How do people approach TV-as-entertainment?

With the announcement of the [new AppleTV][2], Apple has made their vision clear: apps are the future of TV.

This isn't revolutionary or particularly shocking. It's a natural evolution of the AppStore model that's now firmly entrenched in the post-PC world. Migrating the idea of "channels" to "apps" brings a lot of benefits, making TV more than just a screen with video.

Sports apps have the most obvious implementations. Games could be shown with the "director's track" or allow users to choose their own camera angle. Stats could be looked up real time
