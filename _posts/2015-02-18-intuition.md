There's that word again!

Working on an old, sprawling piece of software, written by hundreds of engineers over a dozen years, I'm regularly asked to make a particular feature more *intuitive*. Setting aside the UX-as-lipstick mindset this supposes, it inevitably reminds me--of all things--**The Princess Bride**:

That's probably not fair. My stakeholders really do want an interface so seamless and easy to use that it's intuitive. The problem? It's just not possible.

> [Intuition][Definition]: An immediate cognition of an object not inferred or determined by a previous cognition of the same object.

As interface designers we use all manner of tools to make the interface easier to grasp--[affordances][affordance] makes items look clickable and design patterns reuse common components, relying on user's preconceived notions.

Our techniques lower the learning curve for a new user, but they never eliminate it. Intuition requires *immediate* understanding with no prior knowledge.

The very idea of an intuitive interface assumes some sort of universal truth, that there is one true way to accomplish a given task. This ignores context, the differences in user need and strikes at the core of user experience.

What do you think? Am I being too pedantic? Or, should we wipe the word from the lips of friends and foes alike?
