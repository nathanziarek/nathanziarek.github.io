With the announcement of the [new AppleTV][2], Apple has made their vision clear: apps are the future of TV.

This isn't revolutionary or particularly shocking. It's a fairly obvious way forward and one clearly mapped by the rise of smartphones and app stores. Apps can provide the same content consumption seen today, while having enormous capacity to build engaging interactions standard broadcast TV could only dream of. (Sadly, this probably also means a level of ad annoyance we've never dreamed of, either.)

Sports apps seem to have the most obvious implementations. Games could follow a "director's track" or allow users to choose their own camera angle and stats could be looked up real time.

I'm thrilled at the idea of apps as channels, and can't wait to see what people who think of this stuff full-time are going to come up with.

But, this new world doesn't come without some downside.

Icon Glut

I'm often the person people run to when their phones start acting up. One thing I've noticed among all of them is they can never find the app they have a question about.

As family tech support, I've watched my relatives struggle to find apps, scrolling through 

I have maybe 100 apps on my phone (based on my role as **Family Tech Support**, I'd wager that's low). Even at that number--and with a pretty carefully organized system--I often can't find the app I'm looking for. 

three things:

homescreen clutter -- finding the app among a sea of apps

interface diffrences -- each company trying to out-creative the others

a glut of watchlists

A few months back, I broke down my thoughts on [how to build a better TV experience][1]. There are some nuggets of good ideas in there, but I've come to realize I made a rookie UX mistake: I was enamoured with the features (playing in Keynote was a blast) and lost sight of the story. What are the user's needs? How do people approach TV-as-entertainment?
