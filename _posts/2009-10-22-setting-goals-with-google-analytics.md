Justin Cutroni of EpikOne has a nice review of the new goals (_time on site_ and _pages per visit_) available with version 4 of Google Analytics.

> What's interesting here is that you can create a time based goal if a visit does NOT reach a certain amount of time...I like to think of 'Less Than' goals as 'Failure' metrics.

> For example, when you configure a failure goal you can easily measure and say, ...Did you know that 97% of our traffic does not spend at least 2 minutes on our site? We suck!

Most of the time this is right: a low time-on-site and few page visits would mark failure and be an odd thing to claim as a "goal." However, if you have a sub-profile measuring specific paths --- say a sign-up or check-out form --- the level of friction involved in completing the task could be directly correlated to the amount of time spent on those pages.
