I'd trust Search Engine Land to have the right data, but I'm surprised that the "formulating query" stage of searching is so quick. Still, Google says that half a second leads to 30% increase in searches, so 2 seconds could be quite the boost.

I fall right in line with SEL's thoughts on how this will affect incoming terms. They might shift to shorter terms, but that'd be short lived.
