The title is probably a *touch* of click bate, but there's a lot of merit to this article.

[Brian Millar][Wired] at Wired:

> We should be wary of only designing for ease of use. Thereâ€™s a lot to be said for designing for difficulty of use.

Motivation, mastery, pleasure--Brian's points are worth considering in the context of your product. It'll be a hard sell to product management to purposefully frustrate your customers on the off-chance they'll feel rewarded. 

As with anything, focusing on a single element makes us lose site of the whole. If we over-stress *ease of use*, do we end up creating such a sterile environment there's no emotional investment in the product?
