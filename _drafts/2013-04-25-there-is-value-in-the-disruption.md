#There is Value in the Disruption

A few months back I was working on a tool that automatically updated a form from previous data. The interaction itself was really simple---click a button, form fields update---but the speed of it bugged me. 

It was too fast. 

The before-and-after was so similar---the "Copying..." message so quick---it was hard to tell anything really happened. It was an interesting dilemma. I can be a little obsessive on making things efficient ([speed matters][1], right?!) and yet here I was looking for ways to slow this interaction down.

In [Search Patterns][2], I came across this same idea with regards to AJAX-style page loads. While the elegance of an opacity-animated transition relays a smoothness that round-trip page-loads will never have, it comes at a cost: the user needs to be notified that something changed, and that can be awkward.

It's a fascinating idea. Making things *objectively* better does not always make the better experience.
