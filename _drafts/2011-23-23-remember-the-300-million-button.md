The results were always pretty fantastic, and the backstory takes a little of the mystique away. Was it really that simple?

Then, you look around and realize how many sites are following the exact same paths. This was a big site, probably one visited with some frequency by their customers, yet not often enough that they knew which account they might have registered with.

> We learned a substantial percentage of customers were requesting password reset, approximately 40%. Two out of every five users was getting stuck and needing their password to be reset.

I know my current site doesn't have the kind of stickiness the big guys have. The impact of this change on a smaller, less often visited site will probably lead to a greater change in net revenue.

I'd be curious to understand the impact of adding "Sign in with Twitter"-style buttons. Does that begin to eliminate the friction of sign in completely?
