<p><p>The results were always pretty fantastic, and the backstory takes a little of the mystique away. Was it really that simple?</p>

<p>Then, you look around and realize how many sites are following the exact same paths. This was a big site, probably one visited with some frequency by their customers, yet not often enough that they knew which account they might have registered with.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We learned a substantial percentage of customers were requesting password reset, approximately 40%. Two out of every five users was getting stuck and needing their password to be reset.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know my current site doesn&#8217;t have the kind of stickiness the big guys have. The impact of this change on a smaller, less often visited site will probably lead to a greater change in net revenue.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d be curious to understand the impact of adding &#8220;Sign in with Twitter&#8221;-style buttons. Does that begin to eliminate the friction of sign in completely?</p></p>

<p><p>I&#8217;d trust Search Engine Land to have the right data, but I&#8217;m surprised that the &#8220;formulating query&#8221; stage of searching is so quick. Still, Google says that half a second leads to 30% increase in searches, so 2 seconds could be quite the boost.</p>

<p>I fall right in line with SEL&#8217;s thoughts on how this will affect incoming terms. They might shift to shorter terms, but that&#8217;d be short lived.</p></p>

<h2>Google Instant Proves Me Wrong<br />
<font size=2> [ Posted <a href="http://nathanziarek.tumblr.com/post/1088528664"> Wed, 08 Sep 2010 17:59:36</a> ]</font>
</h2>
<p><p>A few months back I wrote a bit about <a href="http://nathanziarek.tumblr.com/post/269797827/minimalist-google-now-with-hideaway-menus">Minimalist Google</a>, and how the Big G was sacrificing &#8220;load&#8221; speed (the amount of time it takes the browser to download and render a page) to decrease Focus and Query time (or increase perceived speed).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have no reliable way to test, but I'd guess this new page loads and renders slower than it's less-fancy ancestor. If microseconds count â€” a half-second increase in page load time translates to a 20% decrease in traffic â€” wouldn't it benefit the big G to stay away from ...needless“ styling?</p>
  
  <p>The user path of a basic search would look something like this: 
  <img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ku9atifzdI1qzxpmp.png" alt=""/></p>
  
  <p>In this scenario, the visit (typing <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>) and the page load (receiving data and rendering the page) have little room for improvement. My personal load time for the Google homepage is a little over a third of a second&#8230;Similarly, clicking ...submit“ (or pressing enter) and the speed of the results page have little, if any, improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turns out, I was wrong (shocking!).</p>

<p>As before, the added code to create this advanced interaction costs some small measure of speed on the downloading and rendering of the page. But, Google has found both real and perceived speed improvements where I thought technology had pretty much hit its limit.</p>

<p>To start, they&#8217;ve completely removed a step (Submit). While pressing &#8220;Enter&#8221; at the end of typing a search query wasn&#8217;t the most time consuming action known to man, anyone that has ever reached for the mouse to click &#8220;Search&#8221; has shaved seconds from their query.</p>

<p>More importantly, though, the wait between submitting the search and waiting for the results has been taken out of the critical path. With live results, the transition between formulating the query and receiving results blurs. Even if this constant updating slows the page (not sure why it would), it gives the perceived feel of instant results.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking it&#8217;s faster makes it faster.</strong></p>

<p>Google promotes the idea that <a href="http://www.google.com/instant/">Instant can save between 2-5 second per search</a>, based on look-ahead suggestions, shorter queries that produce relevant results, and feedback to show if you are on the right path.</p>

<p>I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised that Google is smarter than me, but I am surprised that they found a way to shave that kind of time from a simple search. Google VP Marissa Mayer said <a href="http://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/11/marissa-mayer-at-web-20.html">"users really respond to speed."</a> I&#8217;m going to take them at their word that this isn&#8217;t the last we&#8217;ll see of speeding the humble search results page.</p></p>

<h2>Is My Web Analytic Software Even Working?<br />
<font size=2> [ Posted <a href="http://nathanziarek.tumblr.com/post/432578598"> Sun, 07 Mar 2010 10:24:00</a> ]</font>
</h2>
<p><p>A recent question on the Google Analytics forums had me thinking about how I test various web tracking solutions.</p>

<p>It seems as if these types of questions fall into two camps:</p>

<ol><li>Recent installs verifying the code is correct and</li>
<li>Number hawks verifying the accuracy of the numbers.</li>
</ol><h2>Number hawks</h2>

<p>The latter group is in for a surprise: there is no way to be confident in the numbers. Web traffic is more an art than a science.</p>

<p>Take the <strong>Ziarek Phone Call Theorem</strong>. A visitor, navigating your site, receives a phone call and stops browsing for 35 minutes before continuing to click around.</p>

<p>Most (perhaps all) analytics tools would consider this 2 visits: The initial browsing, followed by a period of inactivity, followed by more browsing. Because the threshold for inactivity can vary from package to package (one might split the visits at 10 minutes of inactivity, another at half-an-hour), these numbers will often be different, sometimes drastically so.</p>

<p>While the incidence of this particular situation is probably slim, there are plenty of ways (long articles, complex, javascript-driven forms) to incur the same timeout scenario. More important than the &#8220;Visits&#8221; numbers not aligning are the calculations that rely on visits. The cascade of one minor difference in calculation creates significant shifts in the numbers without any being truly &#8220;wrong&#8221;.</p>

<h2>Did I install it right?</h2>

<p>There are a thousand possible configurations for the tracking code, but most errors fall into one of four buckets:</p>

<h3>You&#8217;ve not entered any personalization variables correctly.</h3>

<p>In Google Analytics, for example, there is a string&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(&#8220;<strong>UA-123456-1</strong>&#8221;);</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8230;where <strong>UA-123456-1</strong> specifies your account. The only way to make sure this number is right is to audit. No tricks here, unfortunately.</p>

<h3>You&#8217;ve made customizations to the code, but not all browsers support those customizations.</h3>

<p>(Shame on you for not testing)</p>

<p>Look at the browser report and note if a particular browser is completely absent. If you notice few or no visits from IE (still with 70% of the market), then perhaps your customizations are producing errors in IE. Keep in mind your visitor base &#8212; if you run a Mac blog, the likelyhood of IE visits diminishes.</p>

<h3>The code is installed incorrectly.</h3>

<p>(My experience is with Google Chrome and Apple&#8217;s Safari, although I assume the same results are possible with FireFox/FireBug and Opera. I won&#8217;t make that same assumption with Internet Explorer.)</p>

<ol><li><p>Determine the method of communication between the script on the page and the server. Most software uses an image file &#8212; Google Analytics has <strong>__utm.gif</strong>, WebTrends <strong>dcs.gif</strong> and Clicky <strong>in.php</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In Safari or Chrome, right click on any page that should be tracked and select the Inspector option.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kyx1btFLL81qzxpmp.png" alt="Inspect Element" title="Inspect Element"/></p></li>
<li><p>A window will appear (either attached to the screen or floating above it) with a number of tools. These tools are constantly being changed and upgraded, so don&#8217;t worry if your screen doesn&#8217;t look exactly like this. You are looking for the &#8220;Resources&#8221; tab.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kyx1opCyqt1qzxpmp.png" alt="Inspector Palette" title="Inspector Palette"/></p></li>
<li><p>On the left-hand side you&#8217;ll see a list of all the resources needed to make this page operate. If you see the file from step 1 (__utm.gif in this example), you know that the page is communicating with the server successfully.</p></li>
</ol><h3>You just aren&#8217;t getting any traffic</h3>

<p>Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. At this point, you&#8217;ve pretty-well verified that  you are tracking your visits correctly. If you still aren&#8217;t seeing any traffic, maybe it&#8217;s because you just aren&#8217;t getting any.</p>

<p>My favorite line from Tommy Boy is when Chris Farley gets in the elevator with Dan Akroid. After learning that the Christmas tree smell in the elevator is a car freshener Tommy Boy used as cologne, Akroid replies &#8220;Step one is identifying the cause. Step two is eliminating it.&#8221;</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve identified the issue (and it&#8217;s a bummer), but you know what you need to fix. Advertise, be creative, write more, and engage in social media. Whatever it is your site does, think of all marketing activities in terms of driving traffic.</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Monitoring your web traffic for the first time is a bit of a catch 22. You can&#8217;t know what your traffic might be until you start to monitor it, and you can&#8217;t know if that data is correct without something historic to compare it to.</p>

<p>My suggestion is to worry less about the numbers and focus on the trends. Are you looking to increase revenue? Watch those numbers fluctuate based on your campaigns and tweak as needed. Be less concerned with making ten thousand dollars a month and more concerned with making the <em>next</em> dollar.</p>

<p>The trends will tell you more about what you are doing right than a simple visit number ever will.</p></p>

<p><p>The worst thing my wife can do (especially when hungry) is give me 25 restaurants to choose from. I simply don&#8217;t have the capacity to judge, store and weigh that many options with any sort of relevancy. I&#8217;ll try to research menus and quickly become overwhelmed by appetizers and drink specials. I know more than before, but my decision became much, much harder.</p>

<p>Jeff Stibel with <a href="http://HarvardBusiness.org">HarvardBusiness.org</a> says that <em>knowledge is overrated</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can only comprehend so much. Our minds have limits in our ability to digest information, just as shelves are only meant to hold so many books.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From a user experience POV, this mindset works equally well for an interface. <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/bad-design.html">Jakob Nielson writes</a>, &#8220;every extra design element detracts from all the other design elements on the page.&#8221; Additionally, every additional element on the page adds to the burden of knowledge.</p>

<p>Your interface is only as valuable as your user&#8217;s ability to extract what they need. Don&#8217;t burden them with the unnecessary; lead them through understanding.</p></p>

<p><p>It&#8217;s a good thing I never got too far on my annotations software&#8230; Google has (will?) release an update to Google Analytics that allows you to mark the timeline with notes. This will help tremendously when trying to identify odd spikes and lulls in the data. Plus, these annotations can live with your account or publicly for all who have access to that account.</p>

<p>Hopefully the API will be updated to allow programatic access to add these annotations. The ability to note specific events in an automated manner would make the feature much more useful.</p>

<h2>Minimalist Google (now with hideaway menus!)<br />
<font size=2> [ Posted <a href="http://nathanziarek.tumblr.com/post/269797827"> Sun, 06 Dec 2009 19:10:00</a> ]</font>
</h2>
<p><p><a href="http://uxmag.com">UX Magazine</a> has an <a href="http://uxmag.com/short-news/google039s-magic-trick">interesting note</a> on the changes Google has made to their main search page.</p>

<p>Essentially, they&#8217;ve turned back the clock &#8212; showing only their logo, text box and a couple of buttons &#8212; until you move the mouse, and the now-standard options and links fade in (hover your mouse below to see it in action).</p>

<div id="googlearea" style="background: url(http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ku5qpjU13R1qzxpmp.png)">
    <img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ku5qp9GGG01qzxpmp.png" id="googlescreen"/></div>

<p>My (and other&#8217;s!) gut reaction is that it&#8217;s pretty gimmicky and its usefulness feels pretty limited. Even the smallest mouse movement fades the menu out of hiding, and I have to believe there are more &#8220;mousers&#8221; than &#8220;keyboarders&#8221; out there. Plus, the menus were hardly obtrusive in the first place.</p>

<p>Google&#8217;s core business is connecting users with information &#8212; some free and some <strong>paid</strong>. The faster they can bring users through the search process, the more searches they can run, and the more chances Google has for revenue. As Google VP Marissa Mayer says <a href="http://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/11/marissa-mayer-at-web-20.html">"users really respond to speed."</a></p>

<p>I have no reliable way to test, but I&#8217;d guess this new page loads and renders slower than  it&#8217;s less-fancy ancestor. If microseconds count &#8212; a half-second increase in page load time translates to a 20% decrease in traffic &#8212; wouldn&#8217;t it benefit the big G to stay away from &#8220;needless&#8221; styling?</p>

<p>The user path of a basic search would look something like this:
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ku9atifzdI1qzxpmp.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>In this scenario, the visit (typing <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>) and the page load (receiving data and rendering the page) have little room for improvement. My personal load time for the Google homepage is a little over a third of a second.
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ku9b0kbXtV1qzxpmp.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>Even if there are enhancements that can cut into this number, these are diminishing returns measured in hundredths of seconds. Similarly, clicking &#8220;submit&#8221; (or pressing enter) and the speed of the results page have little, if any, improvement.</p>

<p>Far and away the greatest amount of time is spent on the user acclimating the the environment (Focus) and formulating the query. These can probably be measured in seconds, not microseconds, and hold the best potential to speed the overall process.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve already seen attempts at this. The &#8220;suggest-as-you-search&#8221; feature, similar to the hide-away menus, added some amount of time to the page load and render. That time was made up by faster query entry (for a large portion of the audience) and, in many cases, better results.</p>

<p>Reducing the visual clutter of the page on first entry focuses the user directly on the search box without distraction. The faster they are aware and in control of the tool, the faster they are able to complete their query and get results.</p>

<p>Google, as evidenced by their hosted A/B testing tools, does their homework with regards to how changes affect the overall experience of the site. It&#8217;s impossible to say what the driving force behind any of Google&#8217;s decisions, but we do know that speed is an important metric for them.</p>

<p>Even after all these words, I&#8217;m still not 100% sure I &#8220;get&#8221; the changes &#8212; its just too hard to <em>not</em> see the menus fade in (which distracts me) &#8212; but I&#8217;m willing to admit I don&#8217;t know Google&#8217;s users like they do.</p>

<p>In any case, it&#8217;s exciting to see what could be deemed a &#8220;technology&#8221; problem tackled with a user-experience focus. I expect this feature will be with us until they figure out another, better, <em>faster</em> way to do it.</p></p>

<h2>Three Years Later, Feedburner Finds a Home @ Google<br />

<p><p>Feedburner has always been an outcast in the Google Universe. The purchase was fueled by the incredible growth of RSS and monetization opportunities of a digital subscription medium, but the obvious touch point &#8212; Google Analytics &#8212; never materialized.</p>

<p>The AdSense team (do they run Google Analytics as well?) <a href="http://adsenseforfeeds.blogspot.com/2009/11/afternoon-frank-hey-howdy-george.html" title="Google Analytics Integration with Feedburner">recently announced</a> that these two tools will get a little closer and suggested further integration is on its way.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kt89dbzUDu1qzxpmp.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>Feedburner will remain a separate app, but it will automatically tag any links fed through it with Google Analytics campaign data. While this was always possible when done from the pre-burned feed, the automation saves a step, insures a more consistent result and adds information about where the click originated (Google Reader, etc) that was not previously possible.</p>

<p>The customization options are a nice touch and should give most users the level of detail they are looking for.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kt89dhbEtQ1qzxpmp.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>This integration is basic, but I&#8217;m certainly looking forward to seeing what other touch points the team has in store.</p></p>

<p><p>Justin Cutroni of EpikOne has a nice review of the new goals (<em>time on site</em> and <em>pages per visit</em>) available with version 4 of Google Analytics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What's interesting here is that you can create a time based goal if a visit does NOT reach a certain amount of time&#8230;I like to think of 'Less Than' goals as 'Failure' metrics.</p>
  
  <p>For example, when you configure a failure goal you can easily measure and say, ...Did you know that 97% of our traffic does not spend at least 2 minutes on our site? We suck!“</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the time this is right: a low time-on-site and few page visits would mark failure and be an odd thing to claim as a &#8220;goal.&#8221; However, if you have a sub-profile measuring specific paths &#8212; say a sign-up or check-out form &#8212; the level of friction involved in completing the task could be directly correlated to the amount of time spent on those pages.</p></p>

<h2>Google Ups the Ante with Analytics Enhancements<br />
<font size=2> [ Posted <a href="http://nathanziarek.tumblr.com/post/220035154"> Thu, 22 Oct 2009 10:00:00</a> ]</font>

<p><p>I doubt I&#8217;ll ever understand how Google is able to justify continued development on this excellent tool, but I know enough not to look a gift horse in the mouth. (Actually, as a bit of a city boy, I really don&#8217;t know not to do that, but hope I&#8217;ll remember the adage should the situation ever present itself).</p>

<p>This most recent set of enhancements touch features across the board, including mobile tracking, table filtering, advanced segments and custom reports.</p>

<p>Three things really pop out at me:</p>

<ol><li><p><strong>Mobile tracking</strong> is really just the Google-blessed version of many of the server-side tracking solutions out there to address mobile devices with poor JavaScript support. I find it underwhelming &#8212; easily the weakest of this crop &#8212; in that it is very specialized. As we move into single content sources with targeted stylesheets controlling the output to screen, I think we&#8217;ll move away from specialty mobile sites. These workarounds for <em>web sites</em> will be short-lived, but leave it to Google:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What&#8217;s more, for apps on Android devices, usage can be tied back to ad campaigns: from ad to marketplace to download to engagement. (<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/mobileAppsTracking.html">Analytics Tracking for Mobile Apps</a>)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;ve long thought that the most effective way to monetize Twitter was to take their wealth of realtime data and throw money at some innovative statisticians to develop algorithms and useful metrics that companies don&#8217;t even know they <strong>need</strong> access to.</p>

<p>Google seems to have done something similar (although, again, I don&#8217;t know how without charging for it) with their &#8220;<strong>Intelligence</strong>" system. Their analytic experts have poured through data to discover useful metrics and then developed algorithms that can automatically spot anomalies in your data. "Last Tuesday saw double the number of pages per visit on average" or "this week saw an extraordinarily high bounce rate."</p>

<p>I love this sort of work because it gives non-experts a chance to understand the data that makes up their site in a way that&#8217;s easy to follow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/gaTrackingCustomVariables.html">Custom Variables</a></strong> are going to rock, and they are going to rock hard. Pushing aside the five variable limit, their implementation (living at either the page, visitor or session level) are going to open the door to all manner of innovative and powerful metrics.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still a little unclear on how these will interact with the previous single variable you could set (<code>_setVar()</code> anyone?), but imagine that relatively low-power add-on will be depreciated in due course.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: _setVar() has indeed been depreciated. I&#8217;m in the process of porting my includes over to the new custom tracking code, although I doubt Google will be dropping support for the old way any time soon.</p></li>
</ol><p>There&#8217;s lots more &#8212; including video of the new features &#8212; over at <a href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2009/10/google-analytics-now-more-powerful.html">Google&#8217;s Analytics blog</a>. If this kind of stuff gets your engine revved up, I suggest you take a few minutes to get acquainted.</p>

<p>Am I nuts to think this is really cool stuff?</p></p>

<p><p>I&#8217;m a sucker for car ads, and this seems to be an image they are keen on selling. This is another happy accident &#8230; the camera was pointing out the window (I really wanted the light streaks), but the bumpy road combined with my cheap tripod bumped the camera out of whack. Still, I&#8217;m taking full credit if someone is handing it out :)</p><br /><font size=2> [ Posted <a href="http://nathanziarek.tumblr.com/post/219260288"> Wed, 21 Oct 2009 13:46:08</a> ]</font>

  <p>We&#8217;ve all heard of cases where someone&#8217;s lying sick on the sidewalk, and hundreds of people just walk by without offering help. What&#8217;s going on here? And how can this possibly apply to web design?</p>
  
  <p>What&#8217;s going on is &#8220;Diffusion of Responsibility&#8221;.</p>

<p>PET is a pretty amazing way to think differently about how you present experiences, but it occurs to me that we&#8217;re really just finding new ways to think about our audience.</p></p>

<p><p>So, we&#8217;re in Japan, and we&#8217;ve just stepped off the train in Kashiwa, a very nice town in Chiba which also happens to be the home of Panic&#8217;s Japanese HQ, which itself happens to be essentially a cozy&#8230;</p></p>

<p><p>I, too, am now stuck with the vision of monkeys using gift cards. I think they&#8217;d swipe them with their tails.</p>



<p>via @<a href="http://loloink.tumblr.com/post/151758019/taxes">loloink</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In addition to his presents, I gave William a $5.00 Target gift card (which I had received as a thank you for buying so much damn Sobe water).</p>
<p>Oma sent him $50.00 for his birthday and he immediately wanted to go to Target to buy Wii Resort.</p>
<p>It only dawned on him this morning, as we drove to camp,  that I paid for the game with the $50 AND the gift card. He glared at me, ...That game was only fifty dollars. Why did you use my gift card too?“</p>
<p>I explained that I needed to pay for the taxes. He asked what taxes were and I did my best to explain.</p>
<p>...What?!“ he shouted. Why should MY gift card have to pay for YOUR schools and YOUR mail and YOUR garbage? You are supposed to use your money for that. The price tag said FIFTY DOLLARS!!!“ I welcomed him to the real world.</p>
<p>He cried. He told me that he'd rather be raised by monkeys instead of me.</p>
<p>I briefly launched an irritated tirade that included the words, ...listen“ and ...spoiled“ and ...MONKEYS DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO USE GIFT CARDS.“</p>
<p>I looked up and saw William's scowl in the review mirror. I sounded as ridiculous as he did. ...I should have warned you about taxes,“ I said.</p>
<p>...You should have told me,“ he echoed.</p>
<p>By the time we reached the day camp, he had let it go. I believe he had replaced thoughts of his missing gift card with ones of monkeys shopping.</p>
