I'm a sucker for car ads, and this seems to be an image they are keen on selling. This is another happy accident ... the camera was pointing out the window (I really wanted the light streaks), but the bumpy road combined with my cheap tripod bumped the camera out of whack. Still, I'm taking full credit if someone is handing it out :)
