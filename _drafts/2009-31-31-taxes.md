I, too, am now stuck with the vision of monkeys using gift cards. I think they'd swipe them with their tails.

> It only dawned on him this morning, as we drove to camp, �that I paid for the game with the $50 AND the gift card. He glared at me, ...That game was only fifty dollars. Why did you use my gift card too?�
> 
> I explained that I needed to pay for the taxes. He asked what taxes were and I did my best to explain.
> 
> ...What?!� he shouted. Why should MY gift card have to pay for YOUR schools and YOUR mail and YOUR garbage? You are supposed to use your money for that. The price tag said FIFTY DOLLARS!!!� I welcomed him to the real world.
> 
> He cried. He told me that he'd rather be raised by monkeys instead of me.
> 
> I briefly launched an irritated tirade that included the words, ...listen� and ...spoiled� and ...MONKEYS DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO USE GIFT CARDS.�
> 
> I looked up and saw William's scowl in the review mirror. I sounded as ridiculous as he did. ...I should have warned you about taxes,� I said.
> 
> ...You should have told me,� he echoed.
> 
> By the time we reached the day camp, he had let it go. I believe he had replaced thoughts of his missing gift card with ones of monkeys shopping.
