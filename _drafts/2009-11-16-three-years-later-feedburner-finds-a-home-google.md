## Three Years Later, Feedburner Finds a Home @ Google  
\[ Posted [Mon, 16 Nov 2009 19:27:00][0] \]

Feedburner has always been an outcast in the Google Universe. The purchase was fueled by the incredible growth of RSS and monetization opportunities of a digital subscription medium, but the obvious touch point --- Google Analytics --- never materialized.

The AdSense team (do they run Google Analytics as well?) [recently announced][1] that these two tools will get a little closer and suggested further integration is on its way.

Feedburner will remain a separate app, but it will automatically tag any links fed through it with Google Analytics campaign data. While this was always possible when done from the pre-burned feed, the automation saves a step, insures a more consistent result and adds information about where the click originated (Google Reader, etc) that was not previously possible.

The customization options are a nice touch and should give most users the level of detail they are looking for.

This integration is basic, but I'm certainly looking forward to seeing what other touch points the team has in store.
